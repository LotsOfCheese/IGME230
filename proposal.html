			<h1>About Super Dig Dug</h1>
			<p>
				The arcade hit is back! Dig Dug returns in Super Dig Dug, a reimagining of the classic dig-till-you-drop pump-till-they-pop action. 
				Explore new depths, pop new foes, and utilize a whole new arsenal of powerups!
				Coming to your browser by the end of this semester, probably.

				Super Dig Dug is an expansion of the original Dig Dug game published by Namco in 1982. Staying true to the classic, players will encounter
				Pookas and Fygars in the underground which can be popped with Dig Dug's air pump or squashed by falling rocks. Super Dig Dug also introduces
				two new monsters, one that can explode and one that can dig it's own tunnels! Players will need to utilize more strategy by either finding
				new powerups which can increase Dig Dug's speed and pump reach, or crush monsters with bigger, more dangerous rocks.
